When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're interested in collaborate to someoneelse's project or whant someone else to 
collaborate to yours.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be conflicts beetween the chances made in the github by a third party and
the changes you've made in your local repository
